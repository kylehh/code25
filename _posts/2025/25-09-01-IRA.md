I'm starting a new series, of Finance. Looked into IRA, backdoor, and mega backdoor. These CPA domain knowledge shouldn't be too hard for STEM background ppl. So there are the notes from this [video](). 

## 0 Basic concepts
- Tax-deferred: Defer tax to retirement, like 401K. You will still need to pay tax on it when
- Tax free: Totally no tax, which is the best case.
- After tax: Already have tax paid

| | Contribution | Capital Gains|
|-|--------------|--------------|
Traditional| tax-deferred | tax-deferrd |
After-Tax | after tax | tax-deferred |
Roth | after tax | **tax free** |

## 1 Overview
This is the best overview chart I have seen so far.

401K will have penalty from **59.5**.
After ~72, there will be RMD forced to withdraw from 401K

Can use **BridgeLink** to have more option in 401k (ETF, not stocks)
Here are the limits for each.

## 2 Roth backdoor

This is fully legal now

- Do NOT contribute pre-tax dollars to traditional IRA like converting pre-tax 401K to traditional IRA when leaving a job (so backdoor to Roth IRA ASAP)
- Keep zero balanced in traditional IRA before and after backdoor
- Otherwise, one have to follow the **pro-rata rule** fo Roth conversion
## 3 Mega backdoor
Use after-tax 401k, to use mega backdoor. Nvidia supports Nvidia
Just use 1099 from 401K for tax return purpose
