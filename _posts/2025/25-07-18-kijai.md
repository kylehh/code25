I am really into ComfyUI these days and try out couple of more models and pluggins

## 1 Kijia
Kijia build WanVideo plugin so it can support more models, like MultiTalk. 

So use the plugin developed by Kijia, add this Github [repo](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) into `custom_node` folder and download models from this HF [repo](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/tree/main) can help build video/audio applications

## 2 HiDream
[HiDream](https://vivago.ai/) is a high quality image generation model. Two example workflow can work from image, or from text.This is a typical image generated from it.

## 3 VACE
All-in-One Video Creation and Editing, is an Ali's model for video. It's added and used with WAN for better video generation

## 4 AniSora
This is an image to video model. We can use Kontext to change image to Shinkai Makoto style and generate video from it.
Examples are this picture
