When working with Huggingface, there are lots of classes with suffix **Mixin**. I never thought about it's actually meaning, but turn out to be an important feature. 

Python, unlike some other Object-Oriented languages such as Java or C#, permits **multiple inheritance**.

*A mixin is a special kind of multiple inheritance.* There are two main situations where mixins are used:

- You want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
- You want to use one particular feature in a lot of different classes.

## 1 Mixin examples
[Here](https://dev.to/bikramjeetsingh/write-composable-reusable-python-classes-using-mixins-6lj) is a pizza baking class example:
```python
class PlainPizza:
    def __init__(self):
        self.toppings = []
class OlivesMixin:
    def add_olives(self):
        print("Adding olives!")
        self.toppings += ['olives']
class SistersPizza(OlivesMixin, PlainPizza):
    def prepare_pizza(self):
        self.add_olives()
```
You can also add multiple Mixin but **the main parent class should always be the right-most in the list of superclasses.**
```python
# PlainPizza is be the right-most
class MyPizza(OlivesMixin, SausagesMixin, PlainPizza):
    ... 
```
You can also print out the **MRO (Method Resolution Order)** of a class by `print(ClassName.__mro__)`


## 2 super() 
- Since Python3, we can direclty use `super()` instead of `super(ChildClass, self)` in Python2
- `super()` would call all parents classes in multi-inheritance.
