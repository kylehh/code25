I've been blogging for a long time, starting way back in the BBS days! It's a shame most of my early writing from that time is lost. After that, I moved over to MSN Spaces. When it shut down, everything was transferred to WordPress.com (and you can still find my old blogs there!).

These days, I mostly use WeChat Moments to post pictures and share random thoughts. I wasn't sure if I needed another blog, but then it hit me: I could use it to keep track of my learning. I've been diving into topics like Stable Diffusion on Lilian Weng's blog and all sorts of AI/ML concepts from Hung-yi Lee's YouTube lectures.

The only problem is, I forget things pretty easily after a while. So, I'm going to start writing it all down here. It'll be a great way for me to review what I've learned and hopefully learn it even better. Feel free to check out my posts and join me on the journey!"
